# Triangle-Reader
Test cases where not created in advance of creating the code.
this resulted in paradox problems that could have been solved in the preproduction phase.
I'm very angry at myself but I geuss it was a good way of seeing the value of test driven development

Test Cases:

input 3 equal positive values

expected result: it confirms it's a Equilatera.

result: positiv

Input 3 different positive values

expected result: it confirms it's a Scalene.

result: positiv

Input 2 equal positive values and 1 positive value seperate of the two.

expected result: it confirms it's a Isosceles.

result: positiv

Input 3 values where 1 is equal or below 0

expected results: confirms it's not possible for these values to form a triangle.

result: positiv
